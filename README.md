  <h2>Football Turf Management System</h2>
  <p>
    The <strong>Football Turf Management System</strong> is a Java-based console application built to simplify and streamline the process of booking turfs and coordinating practice sessions for both players and coaches. It implements key object-oriented principles—such as <em>abstraction, inheritance,</em> and <em>polymorphism</em>—and uses custom exceptions to handle common runtime issues like invalid selections, duplicate bookings, maintenance conflicts, and authentication failures; these design choices make the codebase easy to read, extend, and test. At its core the system offers role-based actions (players can view and book available slots, coaches can schedule practices), a singleton-style session manager for simple state handling, and modular classes that separate responsibilities (user management, booking logic, and validation). While the current implementation is console-driven and intended as a learning-oriented prototype, it is intentionally structured so developers can adopt improvements without refactoring the entire codebase: adding persistent storage (file-based or a relational database) will preserve bookings and users across restarts, swapping the console I/O for a GUI (JavaFX/Swing) or REST API (Spring Boot) will open the project to real users, and integrating payment gateways, email/SMS notifications, role-based admin controls, and analytics dashboards will elevate it to production standards. For contributors and maintainers, recommended short-term enhancements include fixing small typos in validation logic, centralizing exception messages for consistent user feedback, and writing unit tests for booking and conflict-resolution paths; medium-term steps include implementing persistence, authentication tokens, and basic CI/CD pipelines; long-term, consider redesigning the backend as a service with a modern frontend to support multiple turf locations, multi-day scheduling, and usage reporting. Overall, this project demonstrates solid Java fundamentals and provides a clear, extensible foundation for building a professional turf-booking platform—it's a practical educational prototype with direct paths to real-world, production-ready improvements, and I recommend starting by adding persistence and automated tests to make the codebase robust and ready for collaboration.
